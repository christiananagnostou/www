This repo houses my personal site, www.christiancodes.co. It’s a straightforward Next.js app with TypeScript, Strava integration for activity data, Styled Components for styling, and Framer Motion for a bit of polish — nothing fancy, just a clean log of what I’ve been up to.

## Setup and Running

## Contributing

This is my personal gig, but if you catch a bug or have a tweak in mind, I’m not above a solid PR or issue. Knock yourself out.
