Remember when our teachers said we couldn't just copy text directly from a book, drop it into our papers without citing it, and call it ours? Teachers scanned our papers for plagiarism and would give a harsh scolding if it were ever found...even threatening with expulsion. The point our teachers wanted to get across was that using others' work as our own is against our honor.

The lines blur, however, when it comes to AI. It doesn't really have an author, so should we consider it plagiarism to use without citation? For now, it is possible to detect the use of AI in writing, but even if AI gets to the point where it's indiscernible from human writing, it isn't as valuable as human writing. Trying to get value out of something as cheap as an AI response is not going to get us far. We need pure, human generated writing to make something meaningful. Using AI to help write our papers, articles, or anything of meaning is not going to bring anything new to the table and we surely aren't getting better at writing along the way.

Even outside the scope of writing, authentic human creation has become more valuable than ever. As we continue to create, it's important to keep true to ourselves and to give credit where credit is due. Obviously, AI has its place, but what we use it for is ultimately up to us.
