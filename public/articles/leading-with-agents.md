I was an early adopter of GitHub Copilot back in late 2021. I’ve experienced, firsthand, how the AI software industry has gone from being an advanced autocomplete to what it is today. We’re approaching a time where the role of each engineer will be to lead their own team - it’s just that the team is not human - they’re agents. I have no shame saying that, as a lead engineer for our team, I have not written code in more than 6 months.

I have fully adopted agentic coding and have been able to ship meaningful production changes at Vuori because of it. I’ve spent time researching tools, analyzing our codebase, coming up with and creating tickets, implementing new features, fixing security vulnerabilities, shipping internal tools, reviewing others’ work, and managing various third-party applications ALL without leaving the Claude CLI.

Out of the box, Claude Code is immediately impactful for anyone who uses it. And it only gets more powerful the more time you invest in learning and applying its deeper features. It doesn’t replace the skills engineers have developed; instead, it complements them and builds on our knowledge to make us more capable in our roles. It removes the burden of tedious tasks and improves the quality of life to free up time for more interesting work. It regularly invokes deeper and more precise thinking from the user, leading to better quality work and deeper understanding.

It takes a culture of curiosity and willingness to change to reach adoption at every level of the organization, but it’s not something we can solve top-down. We need the people with the boots on the ground to lean in and use these tools. All devs should have access, project managers should have access, engineering leaders should have access - everyone, no matter the role, should develop the skill of using these tools and should be expected to leverage them for their own specific use case because the tools are capable of doing so. I can confidently say that it will lift the individual and the organization as a whole to new heights.
